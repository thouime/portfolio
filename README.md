## Game Project: Skydle
- This game combines Skyblock concepts, passive resource accumulation through Idling, and elements of incremental growth and automation, with a touch of collecting. The goal is to create a unique blend that doesn’t exist in one game yet.

- Developing this project allowed me to practice programming and project management skills while building something I’ll enjoy.
